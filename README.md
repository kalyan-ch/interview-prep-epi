## Trips and Tricks

### Primitive Types and Bit Manipulation

1. find if x is a power of 2 : (x & (x-1)) == 0
2. clear all bits to the left of a bit : (num & ((1 << i)- 1))
3. divide x by 2: x >>= 1
4. multiply x by 2: x <<= 1;
5. find if x is even: (n&1) == 0
6. XOR with 0 retains the value of the bit while with 1 flips the value
7. clear the lowermost set bit - num & (num -1)

### Arrays and Strings
