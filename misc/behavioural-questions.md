# Behavioral Questions

Some of the most common behavioral questions asked at tech interviews

### Why do you want to work for X company?

Answer should include the responsibilities of the role and also why the company appeals to you. Align your goals and interests with what the role offers in terms of job description.

### Why do you want to leave your current/last company?

Be honest without being too detailed. Stay positive and keep your answer short.

Unfortunately I was impacted by a company restructuring move that resulted in a loss of 5% of our employees. In the meantime, I’ve been thoughtfully considering my next move, reconnecting with my network and researching opportunities. I’m excited about this position because it exemplifies the parts of my past work I enjoyed the most and will position me in the direction I’ve always wanted to pursue in my career.

### What are you looking for in your next role?

Interviewers ask this to know if the candidate is retain-able, if the candidate has a personality that fits with company's values and culture and know the candidate's motivation. Be specific when answering this question. Prepare your answers in such a way that conveys your motivation.

I'm looking for a role that gives me the opportunity to not only apply my skills but also improve them and learn new ones. I look forward to utilize my programming and software design skills to solve company's problems efficiently. I also enjoy working with different teams and learning more about the organization and core product. I'm also looking for more technical challenges that would utilize and improve my skills. After reading the job description, I think this role would help me achieve all that. Therefore, I was excited to interview for the position.

### Tell me about a time when you had a conflict with a co-worker.

This question warrants the classic STAR method. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Describe the situation
2. Discuss your approach
3. Highlight the results
4. Talk about what you learned

On a story that adds improvements over excel file generation, my coworker and me had a conflict. This story involves changes to a method that had quite a bit of messy code. As part of my changes I have refactored the method so it is more readable and maintainable but my coworker, during review, said that this change was too drastic and the change needs to be done in a more workaround kind of way. 

I met with them, over zoom, and their argument made sense because such a drastic change would add more hours to QA's already hectic timeline since it would need more regression testing. Therefore, I have made the change in the way my coworker intended but as a compromise we agreed to create a tech debt story to fix that method later.  
```

### Tell me about a time in which you had a conflict and needed to influence somebody else.

This is similar to above but emphasizing on what you did when you had to influence someone. Usually the best way to do this is to convince the other person by making them see from your perspective. If they are not convinced, it is better to come to a compromise in terms of finding a common middle ground. 

### What project are you currently working on?

Talk about any project that you know everything of, at least on a high level.  

### What is the most challenging aspect of your current project?

Consider any previous challenges you've faced and tailor your answer to fit the job description. Best thing to do is to review job description of the role prior to the interview. Be specific on why they were challenges. STAR method can be of help here.

One of the projects I worked on during my time at Workday was "publish plan". The purpose of this project was to integrate data between adaptive planning and workday core. I worked as a full stack developer, creating ui pages in react and developing rest APIs in Java.

One of the challenges for me, in the project, was to learn react js from scratch. I've done full stack developer role long back but apart from that I've been a backend engineer for most of my career. I was able to learn react and start work on the project pretty quickly.

As part of this project, I was involved in many design discussions as well. I had to collaborate with project manager team to nail down requirements and design the behavior of ui pages and the data flow of some use cases. As part of this we ran through different use cases with the pm team and went with which ever way made more sense.
